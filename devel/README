This directory contains files that are relevant for development
of bitarray, as well as additional tests and verifications.


copy_n.py
    Illustrate how copy_n() in _bitarray.c works.  This is essentially
    a Python implementation of copy_n() with output of the different stages
    of the bitarray we copy into.


random/
    development files for statistical tests


resize/
    Things to study the bitarray resize function, including the growth
    pattern it creates and tests for the current implementation.


shift_r8.c
    C program is to illustrate and document shift_r8()


test_debug.py
    Tests for internal C code which is exposed in debug builds.
    These tests will only work when bitarray is compiled in debug mode.


test_sum_indices.py
    Additional tests for util.sum_indices() for very large n, as well as
    some verifications and test for the internal function _ssqi().


test_random.py
    * statistical tests for random functions in bitarray.util
    * verification of some statistical equations
    * verification of code used in random_k() and random_p()


tricks.py
    Some little tricks and verifications for some code which is used
    mostly in the C implementation of bitarray.
