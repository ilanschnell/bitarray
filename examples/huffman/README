compress.py:
    Demonstrates how Huffman codes can be used to efficiently
    compress and uncompress files (text or binary).
    Given an input file, calculates the number of occurrences for each
    character; from those frequencies, a Huffman tree is build.
    Also allows encoding and decoding of a file, see -h option.


huffman.py:
    Library containing useful functionality for working with Huffman trees
    and codes.
