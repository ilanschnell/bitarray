All files under this 'examples/' directory are unsupported.

While bitarray itself still supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.5+, the examples
usually require Python 3.


bloom.py
    Demonstrates the implementation of a "Bloom filter", see:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter


copy_n.py
    Illustrate how copy_n() in _bitarray.c works.  This is essentially
    a Python implementation of copy_n() with output of the different stages
    of the bitarray we copy into.


distance.py
    Implementation of distance functions and comparison to the
    corresponding functions in the scipy.spatial.distance module.


extend_json.py
    Demonstrates how to construct a json encoder and decoder (using the
    'json' standard library) which can handle extended Python data structures
    containing bitarrays.


gene.py
    Shows how gene sequences (ATGC) can be very easily and efficiently
    represented by bitarrays.


huffman/
    Directory containing a library and examples for working with Huffman
    trees and codes.


lexico.py
    Contains two functions, all_perm and next_perm, which are handle
    lexicographical permutations of bitarrays.


lfsr.py
    Linear Feedback Shift Register


mandel.py
    Generates a .ppm image file of size 4000 x 3000 of the Mandelbrot set.
    Despite its size, the output image file has only a size of slightly
    over 1.5 Million bytes (uncompressed) because each pixel is stored in
    one bit.
    Requires: numba


mmapped-file.py
    Demonstrates how to memory map a file into a bitarray.


ndarray.py
    Demonstrates how to efficiently convert boolean data from a bitarray
    to a numpy.ndarray of dtype bool.
    Requires: numpy


pbm.py
    Defines a simple class called PBM (Portable Bit Map) which allows:
    - addressing pixels by their coordinates
    - storing and loading .ppm (P4), which is the same as .pbm, files


puff/
    DEFLATE decompression implementation based on Mark Adler's excellent
    https://github.com/madler/zlib/blob/master/contrib/puff/puff.c


resize/
    Things to study the bitarray resize function, including the growth
    pattern it creates and tests for the current implementation.


shift_r8.c
    C program is to illustrate and document shift_r8()


sieve.py
    Demonstrates the "Sieve of Eratosthenes" algorithm for finding all prime
    numbers up to a specified integer.


smallints.py
    A class is defined which allows efficiently storing an array of
    integers represented by a specified number of bits (1 through 8).
    For example, an array with 1000 5 bit integers can be created,
    allowing each element in the array to take values form 0 to 31,
    while the size of the object is 625 (5000/8) bytes.
