Bitarray representations
========================

The bitarray library offers many ways to represent bitarray objects.
Here, we take a closer look at those representations and discuss their
advantages and disadvantages.


Binary representation
---------------------

The most common representation of bitarrays is it's native binary string
representation, which is great for interactively analyzing bitarray objects:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bitarray import bitarray
    >>> a = bitarray('11001')
    >>> repr(a)  # same as str(a)
    "bitarray('11001')"
    >>> a.to01()  # the raw string of 0's and 1's
    '11001'

However, this representation is very large compared to the bitarray object
itself, and it not efficient for large bitarrays.


Byte representation
-------------------

As bitarray objects are stored in a byte buffer in memory, it is very
efficient (in terms of size and time) to use this representation of large
bitarrays.  However, this representation is not very human readable.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> a = bitarray('11001110000011010001110001111000010010101111000111100')
    >>> a.tobytes()  # raw buffer
    b'\xce\r\x1cxJ\xf1\xe0'

Here, the number of unused bits within the last byte, as well as the bit
endianness, is not part of the byte buffer itself.  Therefore, extra work
is required to store this information.  The utility function ``serialize()``
adds this information to a header byte:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bitarray.util import serialize, deserialize
    >>> x = serialize(a)
    >>> x
    b'\x13\xce\r\x1cxJ\xf1\xe0'
    >>> b = deserialize(x)
    >>> assert a == b and a.endian() == b.endian()

The header byte is structured the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> x[0]        # 0x13
    19
    >>> x[0] % 16   # number of unused bits (0..7) with last byte
    3
    >>> x[0] // 16  # bit endianness: 0 little, 1 big
    1

Hence, valid values for the header byte are in the ranges 0 .. 7
and 16 .. 23 (inclusive).  Moreover, if the serialized bitarray is
empty (``x`` only consists of a single byte - the header byte), the
only valid values for the header are 0 and 16 (corresponding to a
little-endian and big-endian empty bitarray).
The functions ``serialize()`` and ``deserialize()`` are the recommended and
fasted way to (de-) serialize bitarray objects to bytes objects (and vice
versa).  The exact format of this representation is guaranteed to not
change in future releases.


Hexadecimal representation
--------------------------

As four bits of a bitarray may be represented by a hexadecimal digit,
we can represent bitarrays (whose length is a multiple of 4) as a hexadecimal
string:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bitarray.util import ba2hex, hex2ba
    >>> a = bitarray('1100 1110 0001 1010 0011 1000 1111')
    >>> ba2hex(a)
    'ce1a38f'
    >>> hex2ba('ce1a38f')
    bitarray('1100111000011010001110001111')

Note that the representation is different for the same bitarray if the
endianness changes:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> a.endian()
    'big'
    >>> b = bitarray(a, 'little')
    >>> assert a == b
    >>> b.endian()
    'little'
    >>> ba2hex(b)
    '3785c1f'

The functions ``ba2hex()`` and ``hex2ba()`` are very efficiently implemented
in C, and take advantage of byte level operations.


Base 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 representation
------------------------------------------

The utility function ``ba2base()`` allows representing bitarrays by
base ``n``, with possible bases 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64.
The bitarray has to be multiple of length 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 respectively.
Here is an example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bitarray.util import ba2base, base2ba
    >>> a = bitarray('001010011010100000111011100110110001111100101110000100010010')
    >>> len(a) == 60    # divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
    True
    >>> ba2base(2, a)   # binary
    '001010011010100000111011100110110001111100101110000100010010'
    >>> ba2base(4, a)   # quaternary
    '022122200323212301330232010102'
    >>> ba2base(8, a)   # octal
    '12324073466174560422'
    >>> ba2base(16, a)  # hexadecimal
    '29a83b9b1f2e112'
    >>> ba2base(32, a)  # base 32 (using RFC 4648 Base32 alphabet)
    'FGUDXGY7FYIS'
    >>> ba2base(64, a)  # base 64 (using standard base 64 alphabet)
    'Kag7mx8uES'

Note that ``ba2base(2, a)`` is equivalent to ``a.to01()`` and
that ``ba2base(16, a)`` is equivalent to ``ba2hex(a)``.
Unlike ``ba2hex()``, ``ba2base()`` does not take advantage of byte level
operations and is therefore a lot slower, although still implemented in C.
The inverse function is called ``base2ba()``.
