Change log
==========

2021-XX-XX   1.9.2:


**1.9.1** (2021-04-05):
  * switch documentation from markdown to reStructuredText
  * add tests


**1.9.0** (2021-04-03):
  * add shift operations (``<<``, ``>>``, ``<<=``, ``>>=``), see `#117 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/117>`__
  * add ``bitarray.util.ba2base()`` and ``bitarray.util.base2ba()``,
    see last paragraph in `Bitarray representations <examples/represent.rst>`__
  * documentation and tests


**1.8.2** (2021-03-31):
  * fix crash caused by unsupported types in binary operations, `#116 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/116>`__
  * speedup initializing or extending a bitarray from another with different
    bit endianness
  * add formatting options to ``bitarray.util.pprint()``
  * add documentation on `bitarray representations <examples/represent.rst>`__
  * add and improve tests (all 291 tests run in less than half a second on
    a modern machine)


**1.8.1** (2021-03-25):
  * moved implementation of and ``hex2ba()`` and ``ba2hex()`` to C-level
  * add ``bitarray.util.parity()``


**1.8.0** (2021-03-21):
  * add ``bitarray.util.serialize()`` and ``bitarray.util.deserialize()``
  * allow whitespace (ignore space and ``\n\r\t\v``) in input strings,
    e.g. ``bitarray('01 11')`` or ``a += '10 00'``
  * add ``bitarray.util.pprint()``
  * When initializing a bitarray from another with different bit endianness,
    e.g. ``a = bitarray('110', 'little')`` and ``b = bitarray(a, 'big')``,
    the buffer used to be simply copied, with consequence that ``a == b`` would
    result in ``False``.  This is fixed now, that is ``a == b`` will always
    evaluate to ``True``.
  * add test for loading existing pickle file (created using bitarray 1.5.0)
  * add example showing how to `jsonize bitarrays <examples/extend_json.py>`__
  * add tests


**1.7.1** (2021-03-12):
  * fix issue `#114 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/114>`__, raise TypeError when incorrect index is used during
    assignment, e.g. ``a[1.5] = 1``
  * raise TypeError (not IndexError) when assigning slice to incorrect type,
    e.g. ``a[1:4] = 1.2``
  * improve some docstrings and tests


**1.7.0** (2021-02-27):
  * add ``bitarray.util.urandom()``
  * raise TypeError when trying to extend bitarrays from bytes on Python 3,
    ie. ``bitarray(b'011')`` and ``.extend(b'110')``.  (Deprecated since 1.4.1)


**1.6.3** (2021-01-20):
  * add missing .h files to sdist tarball, `#113 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/113>`__


**1.6.2** (2021-01-20):
  * use ``Py_SET_TYPE()`` and ``Py_SET_SIZE()`` for Python 3.10, `#109 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/109>`__
  * add official Python 3.10 support
  * fix slice assignment to same object,
    e.g. ``a[2::] = a`` or ``a[::-1] = a``, `#112 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/112>`__
  * add bitarray.h, `#110 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/110>`__


**1.6.1** (2020-11-05):
  * use PyType_Ready for all types: bitarray, bitarrayiterator,
    decodeiterator, decodetree, searchiterator


**1.6.0** (2020-10-17):
  * add ``decodetree`` object, for speeding up consecutive calls
    to ``.decode()`` and ``.iterdecode()``, in particular when dealing
    with large prefix codes, see `#103 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/103>`__
  * add optional parameter to ``.tolist()`` which changes the items in the
    returned list to integers (0 or 1), as opposed to Booleans
  * remove deprecated ``bitdiff()``, which has been deprecated since version
    1.2.0, use ``bitarray.util.count_xor()`` instead
  * drop Python 2.6 support
  * update license file, `#104 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/104>`__


**1.5.3** (2020-08-24):
  * add optional index parameter to ``.index()`` to invert single bit
  * fix ``sys.getsizeof(bitarray)`` by adding ``.__sizeof__()``, see issue `#100 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/100>`__


**1.5.2** (2020-08-16):
  * add PyType_Ready usage, issue `#66 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/66>`__
  * speedup search() for bitarrays with length 1 in sparse bitarrays,
    see issue `#67 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/67>`__
  * add tests


**1.5.1** (2020-08-10):
  * support signed integers in ``util.ba2int()`` and ``util.int2ba()``,
    see issue `#85 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/85>`__
  * deprecate ``.length()`` in favor of ``len()``


**1.5.0** (2020-08-05):
  * Use ``Py_ssize_t`` for bitarray index.  This means that on 32bit
    systems, the maximum number of elements in a bitarray is 2 GBits.
    We used to have a special 64bit index type for all architectures, but
    this prevented us from using Python's sequence, mapping and number
    methods, and made those method lookups slow.
  * speedup slice operations when step size = 1 (if alignment allows
    copying whole bytes)
  * Require equal endianness for operations: ``&``, ``|``, ``^``, ``&=``, ``|=``, ``^=``.
    This should have always been the case but was overlooked in the past.
  * raise TypeError when trying to create bitarray from boolean
  * This will be last release to still support Python 2.6 (which was retired
    in 2013).  We do NOT plan to stop support for Python 2.7 anytime soon.


**1.4.2** (2020-07-15):
  * add more tests
  * C-level:
      - simplify pack/unpack code

**1.4.1** (2020-07-14):
  * add official Python 3.9 support
  * improve many docstrings
  * add DeprecationWarning for ``bitdiff()``
  * add DeprecationWarning when trying to extend bitarrays
    from bytes on Python 3 (``bitarray(b'011')`` and ``.extend(b'110')``)
  * C-level:
      - Rewrote ``.fromfile()`` and ``.tofile()`` implementation,
        such that now the same code is used for Python 2 and 3.
        The new implementation is more memory efficient on
        Python 3.
      - use ``memcmp()`` in ``richcompare()`` to shortcut EQ/NE, when
        comparing two very large bitarrays for equality the
        speedup can easily be 100x
      - simplify how unpacking is handled
  * add more tests


**1.4.0** (2020-07-11):
  * add ``.clear()`` method (Python 3.3 added this method to lists)

  * add example to study the resize() function
  * improve some error messages

    the ``.fromstring()`` or ``.tostring()`` methods, which have been removed
    in the last release


**1.3.0** (2020-07-06):
  * add ``bitarray.util.make_endian()``
  * ``util.ba2hex()`` and ``util.hex2ba()`` now also support little-endian
  * add ``bitarray.get_default_endian()``
  * made first argument of initializer a positional-only parameter
  * remove ``.fromstring()`` and ``.tostring()`` methods, these have been
    deprecated 8 years ago, since version 0.4.0
  * add ``__all__`` in ``bitarray/__init__.py``
  * drop Python 3.3 and 3.4 support


**1.2.2** (2020-05-18):
  * ``util.ba2hex()`` now always return a string object (instead of bytes
    object for Python 3), see issue `#94 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/94>`__
  * ``util.hex2ba`` allows a unicode object as input on Python 2
  * Determine 64-bitness of interpreter in a cross-platform fashion `#91 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/91>`__,
    in order to better support PyPy

  * fix issue `#68 <https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray/issues/68>`__, ``unittest.TestCase.assert_`` deprecated
  * improved test suite - tests should run in about 1 second
  * update documentation to use positional-only syntax in docstrings
